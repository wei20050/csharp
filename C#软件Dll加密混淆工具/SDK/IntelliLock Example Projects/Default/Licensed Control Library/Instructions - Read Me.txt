This project demonstrates how to license a control without writing a single line of code. The license file will be automatically embedded within the corresponding main application at build time. The IntelliLock SDK library IntelliLock.Licensing.dll is only used to display the current license status. 

To test this project:
1.  Build the project
2.  Open the IntelliLock project file licensed_control.ilproj (located in the debug folder) with IntelliLock
3.  Click "Finalize" to protect the control library with an evaluation lock
4.  Click "Create License" (tab "License Manager") to create a license file 
5.  Copy the license file to the location of your protected DLL
5.  Optional: Copy the protected DLL together with your license file into the GAC
6.  Create a new Visual Studio project and add the control to the IDE toolbox (using Choose Items...)    
7.  Drag the control onto the form. In case no nag screen is shown your control is successfully licensed.
8.  Now if you build/compile your project the license file will be automatically embedded within your compiled assembly
