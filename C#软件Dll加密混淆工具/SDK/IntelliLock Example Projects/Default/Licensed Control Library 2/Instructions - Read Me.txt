This project demonstrates how to license a control library using the IntelliLock SDK. The license file will be automatically embedded within the corresponding main application at build time. 

To test this project:
1.  Build the project
2.  Open the IntelliLock project file licensed_control.ilproj (located in the debug folder) with IntelliLock
3.  Click "Finalize" to protect the control library with an evaluation lock
4.  Click "Create License" (tab "License Manager") to create a license file 
5.  Optional: Copy the protected DLL into the GAC
6.  Create a new Visual Studio project and add the control to the IDE toolbox (using Choose Items...)    
7.  Drag the control onto the form (the install license form should be displayed now)
8.  Select the created license file (step 4.) and click the "OK" button
9.  Now if you build/compile your project the license file will be automatically embedded within your compiled assembly
