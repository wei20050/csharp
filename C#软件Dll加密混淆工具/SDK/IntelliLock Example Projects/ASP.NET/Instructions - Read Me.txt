This project demonstrates how to license an ASP.NET Web Application. The IntelliLock SDK library IntelliLock.Licensing.dll is used to display the current license status.  

To test this project:
1.  Build and deploy (folder 'Delpoyed') the Web Application
2.  Open the file project.ilproj with IntelliLock
3.  Click "Finalize" to protect the compiled assembly with an evaluation lock
4.  Copy the protected assembly into the Bin directory (Delpoyed_Licensed')
5.  Click "Create License" (tab "License Manager") to create a license file 
6.  Copy the license file into the App_Data directory (folder 'Delpoyed_Licensed')
